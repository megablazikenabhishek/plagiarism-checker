# C++ Code Plagiarism Detection

This is a Streamlit application for detecting plagiarism in C++ code using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The application allows users to input their C++ code and compare it against a dataset of C++ files to identify similarities.

## Features

- **Input**: Users can paste their C++ code into a text area.
- **Plagiarism Detection**: The application calculates the similarity score between the user's code and multiple C++ files in a dataset.
- **Visualizations**: The application displays similarity scores using:
  - A bar chart showing similarity scores for all dataset files.
  - A heatmap visualizing the similarity scores.
  - A pie chart summarizing the plagiarism detection results.
